The Homies Smart Lock project allows for the remote control of a household door lock using a mobile application (developed on Blynk) connected over a database. 
It is comprised of one primary system and two subsystems, all of which interact concurrently via a laptop internet connection to the Blynk database.  

The primary system is built around a Raspberry Pi 4 and a servo motor to provide physical lock and unlock functionality.     

The LED subsystem is built around a Raspberry Pi 4 and an LED, reading values from the Blynk database to indicate the lock/unlock state of the primary system with the LED.    

The OLED subsystem is built around a STM32 microcontroller and an OLED graphics display, reading values from the Blynk database to indicate the lock/unlock state of the primary system with graphical text.
